- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 1 hr 15 mins
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 400g high fat pork belly (skin removed - ideally belly slices)
- large thumb of ginger
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1 scotch bonnet chilli
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 spring onion

## Directions

1. cut pork belly into 1 inch cubes
2. in a small frying pan place pork cubes fattiest side down in dry pan, put gas on lowest possible flame, cover with lid. ideally your pork covers the entire surface of the small pan - crowding is good for this recipe.
3. lard will render out of the pork allowing it to confit cook in its own juice. low flame essential. you will need to turn the pork 3/4 times until all sides are golden and fat is rendered to melt in mouth levels - this will take approx 1hr.
4. remove pork belly and place in a bowl and cover. remove half the liquified lard and store for other uses.
5. add diced ginger, smashed garlic cloves and chopped chilli and saute in the remaining lard. once softened add ketchup, hoisin sauce, honey and sesame oil. reduce over low heat for a few minutes until thickened.
6. add pork belly back to the sauce and cook on low for a further 2 minutes. leave to stand for 5 minutes then garnish with thinly sliced spring onions. enjoy with steamed white rice.
